 Unattended Debian Upgrades (archived)
==========================

This was a ansible role to install and configure `unattended-upgrades`.


We recomend to use a different ansible role for this. For example this one:
+ Github: https://github.com/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades
+ Galaxy: https://galaxy.ansible.com/jnv/unattended-upgrades
+ Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jnv/ansible-role-unattended-upgrades)
